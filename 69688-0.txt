The galactic patrol cruiser _Parsec_ was coasting--as she had been
for eight months. At a speed of roughly twelve to fifteen light-minutes
an hour, she had been patrolling the Pass--that vast cosmic void
between the II Milky Way Supergalaxy and the I Supergalaxy of Andromeda.

The _Parsec_ was so immense that a man could die in one end and
be buried in space, and those on the other end wouldn't know it
until they read it in their daily _Space Traveler_. She was a
41.261 A.D. model, only four years old, and aside from fuel she was
theoretically capable of sustaining herself in space for a thousand
years--which is just what young Lt. Jim Braniff was afraid she was
going to do.

Lt. Stevens, his roommate, came stamping in from the sixth watch
slapping his hands.

"Cold outside!" He wiped the fog from his glasses. "Must be nearly
freezing. Hear they had a strike in the Heating Corps. The Old Man
better step in and settle that before it gets serious."

Lt. Braniff sighed wearily. "Oh, he'll step in and tell them to go back
to work or go without food. Sometimes I think the Old Man hasn't any
feelings at all."

Stevens stared at him. Stevens was a handsome, dark-haired,
glossy-eyebrowed young man who always seemed to be imbued with the
recklessness of space.

"Homesickness eating on you again?" He snorted. "Why don't you go take
a walk? There are some very nice girls over in the Kitchens."

"It's too far," Braniff said listlessly.

"You can catch a ride on the truck--if you want to." Stevens tossed his
trim space jacket on the bed. "You might as well quit mooning over that
wife and kid of yours. It'll be ten years yet before we get back to
Earth."

"Do you really think it will be that long?" Lt. Braniff, to tell the
truth, was horribly homesick. He was almost so homesick that he didn't
care if Stevens knew it.

He got up and paced the floor while Stevens washed his face. Four years
from home, and six years to go! They had spent three years and four
months getting to the Pass, and they were to patrol it for three years.
Suddenly he felt he couldn't stand it.

"I've got to get promoted," he said aloud. "That's the only answer. If
I could get to the rank of captain by the time we get back, I could
rate a job at home--back on Earth."

       *       *       *       *       *

Stevens looked up, his black eyebrows dripping water. "Don't expect me
to sit back and wait for you to be made a captain. After all, I can use
the money--and the rank."

Braniff knew it. He also knew that Stevens was two years older and
three years more experienced--and, if he wanted to face the truth, a
lot tougher. Stevens would inevitably get the first chance, unless the
admiral should unaccountably soften, and Braniff saw no hope of that.

That very day Admiral Gorthy had given him a dressing-down for failing
to report a tube burned out in the detector. It was a spare tube in the
alternate circuit of the tenth stage of amplification, but the grizzled
old admiral had threatened to keep him a lieutenant the rest of his
life.

Why couldn't the admiral be human? Just because _he_ didn't have
any family back home, he didn't have to be so tough.

"I gave orders for you to inspect those tubes every day. That means
every twenty-four hours. And quit mooning. If everybody were to be like
you, we'd never get home."

But everybody wasn't as lonesome as Lt. Braniff. His only daughter was
now three years old and he hadn't even seen her. His wife--since they'd
left the constellation of Laerta, he hadn't even heard from her. It
took too much power to send personal messages so far.

"You've got to learn to follow orders and do as you're told."

That was the Old Man, unfeeling, uncaring. The only thing he was
interested in was discipline. Lt. Braniff could have been very fond of
the Old Man if the Old Man had been human. All the staff officers felt
that way. The Old Man was always alone, distant, unmoved by anybody
else's troubles.

Yes, Admiral Gorthy undoubtedly would give the first promotion to
Lt. Stevens, and there were not many promotions on a single cruise.
Spacemen were physically perfect, and they didn't often die. They
couldn't resign, they couldn't be transferred. Somehow, the life of a
space officer was not as glamorous as Lt. Braniff had thought it would
be. It would be financially good, for the pay was double what one could
get on Earth, and Lt. Braniff was economical with his money.

The only thing was, the _Parsec_ and its hundred thousand
passengers was like a detached world, coasting through space without
orbit, without sun, without a galaxy, even, without anything but those
great beryllium plates that cut everybody inside from the rest of the
IV Universe.

Lt. Braniff caught himself in mid-stride. He'd better take a turn in
the crisp air. He was getting moody. No, he was already moody. He put
on his jacket and stepped outside. His breath made funnels of steam
under the lights.

He walked the quarter-mile to the bridge. He turned into the big room
that housed all the great complexity of instruments that had to do with
the navigation and maneuvering of a great cruiser. This was not the
administrative headquarters. That was at the opposite end of the vessel
in an alternate control-room. This room was only for the immediate
problems of moving the ship.

He wandered over to the plate that showed space around the ship. In
spite of the fact the plate was positioned on the wall, those black
depths were not actually the depths of the Pass. Few men on the
_Parsec_ had ever seen the Pass itself, and no man there had seen
space outside of the _Parsec_ since the day they had left Earth
four years before.

Lt. Braniff became aware that the junior lieutenant on duty had spoken
to him. "I beg your pardon. What did you say?"

"I said we picked up something on the detector band a little while
back."

Lt. Braniff opened his eyes. "What?"

"The officer of the day thinks it was a ship."

"Did they ask for clearance?"

"No."

       *       *       *       *       *

The control-room was buzzing with talk now. A junior admiral and two
captains were watching the detector plate. "It's within a couple of
a.u.'s," the admiral said, watching intently the faint yellow spot on
the screen.

The young officer with the earphones on his head turned a switch. The
sound of a sharp, broken whistle came from somewhere. "It's metal,
sir," said the young officer.

"Can you estimate the dimensions?" They all waited breathlessly for the
answer. No ship except the _Parsec_ was supposed to be in this
part of the Pass, and certainly no ship on legal business between the
galaxies would fail to identify herself, for the entire IV Universe
knew that the _Parsec_ was the fastest and most heavily armed
space-ship in that part of the Cosmos. Would this be a smuggler, an
unannounced battleship, or even a wanderer from some other universe?

The young officer looked up. "Mass around two million tons, sir."

Eyebrows raised. "Sounds like Zhute," said the admiral. "That's what
we're looking for. Give a reading to the Pilot Room every ten seconds.
I'll have the controls set to follow him. Orderly!" A sergeant hurried
up. "Awaken Admiral Gorthy. Request his presence on the bridge."

"Yes, sir."

Braniff hurried back to tell Stevens. He caught him just as Stevens was
crawling into bed. The man bounced out of his bunk and started putting
on clothes.

"First contact we've made in eight months," he said. "Thanks for
telling me, Mister--but don't think I'll give up my promotion."

Braniff swallowed and tried for a moment to forget about going home.
"Who is Zhute?" he asked.

"Zhute's a renegade robot from somewhere. Nobody even knows what galaxy
produced him. Nobody knows what he looks like. All we know is that he's
done some of the neatest wholesale smuggling that's ever been done in
this section. They know he's the one who runs those multiple-armed
Stenorians through the Pass from the I Supergalaxy to the Fox-men of
Fomelhaut in our galaxy."

"Who are the Fox-men of Fomelhaut?"

Lt. Stevens considered. "Well, I suppose out of some forty billion
constellations in the galaxy, you couldn't learn all about all the
worlds. These Fox-men are on Fomelhaut Twenty-One, a world about the
size of Jupiter. That is, that's their original world. Since then,
they've taken over all the worlds in their system, and as that was
before the galactic federation, nobody can squawk. But there are
trillions of them; they're highly developed mentally, but they're
carnivorous and they're deadly and practically devoid of sentiment. If
they could ever get enough weapons they could raise the devil with the
whole galaxy. Luckily, they haven't developed an opposed thumb."

"How do they make trouble, then?"

Stevens pulled on his boots. "They never got very far until they
enslaved the reptilian citizens on Fomelhaut Eleven. Now of course the
reptiles are freed, and the foxes are on their own, but we do know that
from somewhere they get periodic shipments of these ten-armed fellows
from Stenor, over in the I Supergalaxy, in spite of intergalactic
regulations and in spite of the fact that by smuggling alone they could
start a war between the galaxies."

"Is that why we're out here--to find out how they're getting their
slaves?"

"That's our Number One secret order of business, so they say." Stevens
stood up and slipped into his jacket, took a last look at himself in
the mirror. "Come on, let's move. This may be the only action of ten
years in space."

       *       *       *       *       *

Admiral Gorthy was on deck when they got back, with his grizzled
face watching the ship on the plate. It was now fairly plain as
a space-ship, but it was shaped more like a sphere than the
_Parsec_.

"The idiot!" growled Admiral Gorthy. "Why doesn't he stop? Doesn't he
know we can catch him?"

"He acts," said the junior admiral, "like some sort of alien
intelligence. He may not figure as we do. He might think that if you
could destroy him, you would have done so as soon as you sighted him."

"Maybe so, but he ought to stop now. He should at least answer. Have
you sent out a challenge on the all-wave length, Mr. Hale?"

"Aye, sir," said the radio officer. "I've broadcast on everything we
have."

"And no answer?"

"No acknowledgement, sir."

The grizzled old admiral considered. Braniff knew that none of the
_Parsec's_ many formidable weapons had ever been fired in action.

Gorthy said, "Captain, are we within range for your heat-projectors?"

"Aye, sir," said the ordnance officer.

Gorthy hesitated. "I don't like to blast a strange ship when I have no
idea what in the galaxy she's carrying. Wait until you're close enough
to fuse a couple of her port jets. Then throw a pressor beam and spin
her around. Let's show them we mean business." He frowned. "I don't
like it. There's more going on here than you can see."

Five minutes later the captain of ordnance announced, "The ship is
revolving, sir. She's in an erratic course about half a million miles
off our starboard bow."

Gorthy grunted. "Watch her."

They saw her name then, printed in strange characters that no one could
read. "I'd say she's from the Third Universe," said the junior admiral.
"But what's she doing away over here?"

"She could be off course," said the captain of ordnance.

"Not a hundred thousand light-years off course," growled Gorthy.
"You're the semantics expert, Lt. Braniff. What do you make of her
name?"

"I don't know, sir," said Braniff. "The only guess I can make is that
those symbols have a mathematical origin, but they're definitely not
the symbols of the Triangle-men of Theta Cygni."

Gorthy grunted.

"I think she's getting ready to make for land, sir," said the junior
admiral.

"Where--oh, Inscription Rock. Sure. Where is it now?"

"Half an a.u. to the left, sir, minus twenty degrees."

"Okay. Follow him in."

The _Parsec_ was passing the strange ship now. The _Parsec's_
eighty million tons of mass couldn't be stopped very easily. So Gorthy
had the big ship orbited, while he and a staff of some hundred officers
and men detached themselves in the _Parsec Junior_, one of the
_Parsec's_ two contact boats. Lt. Braniff and Lt. Stevens, being
officers of the line, were included.

The _Junior_ was expelled by a powder charge at the rear, and
immediately began blasting to cut down her own velocity. The strange
ship seemed badly crippled; it was floundering in an apparently aimless
spiral toward the planet called Inscription Rock. They followed it.

"What is Inscription Rock?" asked the junior officer of ordnance.

"Inscription Rock is the graveyard of military ambitions," Gorthy said
gruffly. "It's an orphaned planet from some solar system that nobody
can remember. It has wandered around in the Pass for a million years,
and nobody has ever claimed it because it has nothing on it of value,
and it's too vulnerable to be worth defending as a base. As long as
it has been in the Pass it has been used by conquering admirals and
defeated admirals to stop and repair their ships and gather their
fleets. That planet has seen more intergalactic warfare than any other
piece of solid matter in the Fourth Universe."

"They're going to land, sir," said the captain of the _Junior_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Gorthy did not take his eyes from the plate. "Lieutenant Braniff!"

"Yes, sir." Braniff drew up, with his heart pounding.

"Take the Number Four fighter with a crew of four. Arrest the captain
and crew of that ship and confiscate ship and cargo in the name of the
Galactic Federation."

"Yes, sir."

"You will be backed by Lt. Stevens in Number Two. If there is any
resistance whatever, use the omega-ray."

"Yes, sir." Lt. Braniff was thrilled. That was a drastic order; the
omega-ray was a disintegrator at short range. It meant that Gorthy was
alarmed. Lt. Braniff exulted momentarily. Perhaps if he turned in a
good job on this, he would rate a promotion.

"If you can identify the captain as Zhute, the renegade robot, kill
him without mercy. We can't stand on ceremony, when a wrong move might
plunge a hundred billion solar systems into conflict. We'll stand by up
here--but be careful!"

"Yes, sir."

Five minutes later Braniff and his crew cast off in No. 4 fighter.
The lieutenant was taut, alert. This was his chance. The strange ship
landed rather heavily. Braniff circled her at ten miles, with his
searchlight on her. Presently there was movement. A port opened. A
white flag signaled. Lt. Braniff landed his fighter. There wasn't any
sun for this world. It was dead black. He got out in his bubble and
flexible suit and went toward the ship warily, careful to stay in the
light.

He was remembering what Gorthy had said about starting an intergalactic
war. That meant the first thing to do was establish the identity of the
ship and find out its cargo. He signaled his three men to follow him.
They stalked up to the strange ship. A door opened and a ladder rolled
down. Lt. Braniff went up.

When he got through the strange round airlock he found himself
confronted by a round-bodied, three-legged creature like an octopus
with ten arms. He waited for his companions, then he signaled to the
creature. It moved off. They followed.

In an odd-shaped room fitted with instruments and control levers that
all ended in slender tips to suit the tentacles of the creature that
led them, Lt. Braniff found half a dozen more of them, and finally in
the light that was almost blackness, he saw a different form--a bigger
form.

"Steady!" he said to his men, and turned on his infra-light. Through
his filter-lenses he saw a gigantic robot, ten feet high, as wide as a
barrel. Its steel plates were dull from long lack of polishing, but its
hands swung like steel pistons at the end of its long arms.

[Illustration: Before Lt. Braniff loomed a gigantic robot, ten feet
high and as wide as a barrel.]

"You can turn it off," the robot said abruptly. "You've had a good look
at me."

Lt. Braniff felt queer, but he remembered his job. "Are you Zhute?"

"Yes, I'm Zhute. You forced me down against intergalactic law. I was
minding my own business." The robot's metallic voice sounded bitter.

"You didn't identify yourself."

The robot's head lifted as if in surprise. "You did not signal."

"We did," said Lt. Braniff. "What ship is this?"

"The _Adrraftsha_, from Phad Fourteen."

"That's not in the Two Supergalaxy," Lt. Braniff observed. "Are these
members of your crew from that planet?"

"They are."

"Where are you from?"

"From the Deeps." The robot laughed.

Lt. Braniff understood that. The Deeps were at minus ninety degrees
ascension, a void something like the Pass where the IV Universe thinned
out. Braniff overlooked it.

"What's your cargo?"

"See for yourself."

       *       *       *       *       *

At that moment Braniff heard in his intership phone: "I have orders to
follow you inside in fifteen minutes. This is Lt. Stevens."

"We are okay," said Braniff, "but stay close."

To tell the truth, Lt. Braniff was living ten lives at once. He was in
an alien ship, surrounded by alien entities, talking to a giant robot.
And besides that, they were practically in the dark. These creatures
did not need much light. Lt. Braniff was scared to death.

"Lead the way," he said.

He took one man with him and left two to watch the robot. They followed
a three-legged octopus down a low-ceilinged tunnel. It came to a door,
worked a combination, apparently, and threw the door open. It was
lined with a foot's thickness of lead, and Lt. Braniff shuddered at
the strength in those heavy tentacles. He motioned the creature to go
inside.

The Phaddian waddled in. A moment later it backed out, bearing a heavy
lead box. Lt. Braniff observed the Geiger reading and straightened up.
Hard radiation--plenty hard. If they hadn't been wearing shielded suits
they couldn't have lived through that. He made some quick tests, then
he went back to the robot.

"You will go with us," he said, and held his breath.

The robot shrugged. He turned and led the way out. Lt. Braniff exhaled
and breathed deeply.

He felt still better when they were outside under the searchlights.
Lt. Stevens was there in his bubble. The great robot stood at its full
height. It looked around at the men, at the ships, at the contact boat
floating overhead, with light pouring from its port-holes.

Lt. Braniff knew that this might mean a promotion and it might mean
that he would get a chance to stay home after this trip. He was happy
and elated, but as he looked at Zhute, he felt sorry for the big robot.
It looked a little bewildered. Lt. Braniff thought its shoulders
slumped a trifle.

Then suddenly Zhute turned and ran, its great steel legs taking immense
strides over the granite rock.

Braniff remembered what Gorthy had said about using the omega-ray,
but he couldn't quite bring himself to do that. The robot had
looked so forlorn and friendless, and besides, he wasn't offering
resistance--though Braniff understood that the admiral would be pleased
at any reasonable excuse for the destruction of the robot. But Zhute
couldn't get away. They'd track him down in minutes by his metal body.
So Braniff stood for an instant, watching.

Then Lt. Stevens raised his omega-gun. Braniff saw that, and his
temper flared. Why was Stevens so ready to blast a man--or a robot,
either--just to grab off a promotion? And why must he shoot a helpless
robot in the back?

Braniff wheeled. His right fist, encased in flexible beryllium, came
up hard against Lt. Stevens' bubble. He saw Stevens' head snap back,
then Stevens turned, with a look of amazement on his face. He stared an
instant at Braniff and then he changed hands on the gun and hit back.

The blow jarred Braniff to the bottom of his spine. The bubble seemed
to try to lift his head off. They closed. Stevens tried to bring the
gun to bear on Braniff's head. Braniff kneed him. Stevens backed away,
gasping. Braniff followed. He kicked the gun out of Stevens' hand. Then
a paralysis ray stunned them both....

The next thing Braniff knew, he was being helped up. The grizzled old
admiral stood there with a puzzled expression on his face.

"Lieutenant, will you explain your conduct?"

Braniff swallowed. He realized now with a sinking feeling, that he had
forfeited all his right to promotion.

"I don't know, sir, but Zhute was my prisoner."

Gorthy studied him, apparently in some disgust. Finally he looked down
to where they were bringing Zhute up the rocky slope. He looked back
at Braniff.

"Come with me."

They got into the No. 1 fighter. Gorthy directed the pilot. "There's a
mountain here somewhere with a square face about three miles high--a
black granite mountain," he said.

       *       *       *       *       *

The pilot used his radar. A moment later he had it.

"Take us there," said Gorthy.

Braniff was puzzled, and a little apprehensive. Was the admiral getting
ready to execute him?

The admiral had the ship landed on a point of rock a mile away. They
got out. The lights were on the cliff, and then Braniff saw that
the cliff was covered with inscriptions in many strange and alien
characters.

"All the great military commanders for a million years have left their
marks on that rock," said Gorthy. "This planet has been a place for
fleets to rest and be repaired, for rendezvous between forces, and also
for defeated admirals to stop and lick their wounds. And every one has
left his mark.

"Look up there, clear up on top, at the left. I can't read that, but
I've had it explained to me. Those machine-like marks were made by
Nudghjz, the great Rigellian semi-mineral general who whipped the Milky
Way in the first of the Intergalactic Wars. It says: 'I conquered all.'
And he did. He conquered forty billion suns.

"Over on the left is the vine-like inscription of the famous Capellan
admiral, Llallella, who with his half-plant people and a billion
space-ships from the galaxy swept to a glorious victory over the First
Galaxy itself.

"And on down, one after another. Sardox, the evil cat from Merope;
Vormel from Sirius itself; Fimit from Vega--names that have gone into
the galactic history-books for all time.

"Look up there at the carved boasting of Nudghjz. It's in the granite,
on a planet where there is no atmosphere and therefore no wind, no
storms, no changes of temperature. His name has been there for a
million years. Llallella's was put there fifty thousand years later."

"Yes, sir," said Braniff. "I see, but--"

Gorthy faced him. "Lieutenant, you're a nice young man. You are not
afraid to be sentimental. That's why you hit Lieutenant Stevens for
aiming at Zhute--not because Zhute was your prisoner, but because he
was alone and discouraged. No matter how horrible a criminal he is,
you felt sorry for him then."

Lt. Braniff licked his lips.

The grizzled old admiral was talking straight. "Lieutenant, you've got
a family back home. That's where you belong. You came into the service
because it looked glamorous and because you would make a lot of money,
didn't you?"

Jim Braniff swallowed. "Yes, sir."

"A lot of us come in that way, Lieutenant. That's the way I came
in, sixty years ago. I had a young wife then, but I thought I would
look pretty glamorous to her when I got back. But actually it wasn't
glamorous. It was just the way you see it now. When I finally got back,
she was dead. There was nothing for me to do but stay in the service.
I'll go the same way those admirals and generals went and, when I go,
the only difference between us will be that I haven't cut my name on a
rock. Do you see what I'm driving at, Lieutenant?"

       *       *       *       *       *

Braniff faced him. "No, sir, I'm afraid I don't."

"Some men are fitted for space duty. Some aren't. You're not. Resign
when you get back! Don't be afraid of criticism. The galaxy needs
sentiment--not in the Space Service; we don't dare show it here. But
your memory in the hearts of one generation of your family is worth
more than a million years in rock. Remember that! When you get back to
Earth, get out of it. You're too soft!" he said harshly. "You don't
belong in the Space Service! I'd send you home now if there were enough
fuel!"

He stalked back to the boat. Lt. Braniff watched him a moment with a
softness in his chest, then he followed.

They got in and took off. They reached the _Junior_. Admiral
Gorthy took his place at the screen. "Train your disintegrator on that
tub down there," he ordered the junior officer of ordnance.

"But, sir," cried Braniff, "there are living beings down
there--Phaddians."

"Never heard of them," the admiral said bluntly. "Captain, are you
ready?"

"Yes, sir."

"Prepare to fire. By the way, Lieutenant, what is the cargo?"

"Americium, sir."

"Americium!" The admiral stared at Braniff. "Holy jumping comets! That
much americium would blow us into the Third Universe. But you thought
first of the Phaddians, Lieutenant." The admiral nodded. "That's why
we couldn't get a message through. That stuff's half-life is only five
hundred years. Its radiation has a high speed. Americium is contraband.
I confiscate it. Lieutenant, do you think you could repair that ship
and take it home?"

"I think so, sir."

"Then do it. That load of americium is worth a dozen plutonium mines.
I'll clear you with customs on Agena Centauri."

Suddenly Lt. Braniff realized what the admiral had told him to do.

"Did you say--take it home, sir?" He nearly choked as he tried to
control his emotions.

The admiral glared at him. "Yes, I said take it home!" he snapped.
"What did you think I said?"

All the homesickness and all the lonesomeness and all the longing that
had been in Lt. Braniff's heart for four years welled up into his mind
and almost overwhelmed him. He lifted his head high, trying to speak,
and when the words finally came out, he said:

"That's what I thought you said, sir."

"Pick a crew and get started." The admiral was studying a sky map. "I
think, Captain, we'll set a new course when we get back on board the
_Parsec_. I'd like to take a run over toward the One Supergalaxy
and see if I can pick up a clue as to where Zhute got all this
americium. There must be a new galaxy opening up somewhere." He wheeled
on Braniff. "What the devil are you waiting on, Lieutenant? Get going!"

Lt. Braniff smiled. "Yes, sir," he said, and added under his breath as
he saluted, "You old softie."

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
